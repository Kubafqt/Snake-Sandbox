# Snake-Sandbox
Development version 0.1

Idea of Snake SandBox game. - SandBox of snake game in snake game base.

This is very basic version in development. (+-0.1)

Soon I will develop this project more and optimize database tables. 

After that I will add more new features for better gameplay experience and more sandbox elements.

Other ideas to project: more snakes types, with some spells (much more OOP, better code readability and OOP patterns) [right after, next weekend will be much more OP]

when I will get some more time, I will spend more time on my more interesting projects than some sandbox game [incoming weekend will be much more productive]
